These emotions can include love,              joy, hatred or anger. Passion can drive people to do the best things in life, or it can drive              people to do the most terrible things possible in life. Passion is an important factor in              every single soul on earth. Passion drives me, and many others to achieve goals in life. I              have passion in my life to do the best I can in all I do and make the best out of every              experience. My life has many things that involve endurance of passion. Maintaining the              drive is the only obstacle that I come across.             School is a place where many events take place each and every day. Each day is              filled with some new drama or task that needs to be taken care of. Those tasks may              include many little problems such as finding a ride home from school, homework, test,              appearance, and self-esteem issues. My passion drives to get tremendous grades and              to get through my high school years with memories worth remembrance. It's very              difficult to find the energy to get out of bed each and every morning, but with              encouragement given at school from friends and even some teachers, everyone can make it.             Being involved in school sports and activities is something I have always enjoyed              and experienced. I am an Alta High Varsity cheerleader and it is the most difficult              obstacle I have come across.

Accumulating wealth.This answer might seem shallow and selfish, and I think it might be but it’s what the circumstances have made me into.I will not screw over people or cheat or lie to become rich but i will not stop until i am the top 1%. and from there, i’ll work harder to increase it even further.I come from a middle class family, and my dad passed away when I was 10. The government of my country (God bless its corruption, and discrimination), cheated my mom out of a job which is usually the right of the spouse of someone who dies while they are in service (i.e: my dad). My mom has a very good academic record prior to marrying my dad, and she has a BS in Science. After getting married, she was a housewife and raised my siblings and me.My relatives screwed us over and usurped most of the property that my father had and we were left with a little bit. (Again, corruption, greasing the right palms etc. I won’t go into a lot of detail).Additionally, there was another piece of land that the Government bought from my Grandfather in the 70’s under false pretense, and my grandfather sued the Government for it. The case went on for decades (Ya, you read that right…. welcome to my world), and unfortunately my grandfather passed away before the conclusion of the case. The whole thing got transferred to my dad’s name and the case went on….and guess what happened. He passed away too. The case is still pending and now it’s in my brothers’ and my name. It has been more than 25 years since the lawsuit was filed (he filed it in the late 80’s or the early 90’s i think, i am not sure at this point because i have given up all hope). It’s almost a $200,000 settlement if yo convert the amount to USD.This might seem like a strange thing to someone from Europe or the US or anywhere in the west to understand, but it’s not that surprising in a developing country, and I would say, it’s not a rare occurrence where I come from.There are a lot of things that shaped me into who I am today, but one thing i have learned from everything is: During times of need…money is the only thing that’s useful. Relatives, friends and all the other people only stay useful to a certain extent. And I don’t blame them. They have their own shit to worry about.So i will make as much money as I can, and then some more. I do not want to face what I already have.I am 28 years old now, and I have a master’s degree in Software engineering and a good job in California. I have recently realized that I have slowed down a bit since the past 2 years and kinda lost steam (Maybe I got tired, or just comfortable. I don’t know).

I'm sure it will light a fire in any heart that has a passion!I am passionate about changing the way people think about education. Making people understand that you learn for your life, not for you exams. Giving them problems that makes them think instead of making them memorise stuff. I am an engineering student and I love learning and teaching! I am so passionate about such a seemingly small thing probably because this is not a small thing, this is the most important thing one can learn or do, teach effectively! I have always admired the power a teacher holds. You think a politician is powerful? A humanities teacher incubates hundreds of them. You think an engineer is smart? An engineering teacher handles(and yes, trust me, we need to be handled) more than you would care to be left alone with it. A particle physicist is brilliant? Well you get the point.I mean, every problem, evey solution, ever practice, evey mindset, everything begins with a teacher! Be they you parents, or the playschool teachers who taught you not to fight (but clearly didn't teach it well enough :P), or the secondary/high school teachers and the list goes on...I believe that teachers need to realise that power. And they need to use it for the greater good. They need to dissolve the differences that arise because of caste, color, etc. And they are the only ones, along with the parents, who CAN! Picture this, nobody knows about the caste system, because they stopped teaching or mentioning it years ago and the new generation is unaware of it! How great would that be? People will be biased only based on their skills! You can imagine the possibilities that would come if the teachers just buckled up and took their job seriously. Pardon me, not job, profession!And yes, do not take up this profession when you fail at everything else. Take it when you succeed at everything. This is not a last resort. This should be a childhood dream, to teach! :)Cheers to those who agree!Think harder to those who do not! :)";10-17;1;https://www.facebook.com/ashapak.pathan.39;https://www.upwork.com/fl/nejcznidar11;Senior Software Developer;75;1;"I'm experienced software developer with more than 20 years programming experience.Last 8 years I've been programming backend systems in Python.

I’ve transformed myself in unimaginable ways with the characters I’ve done and that has opened my eyes to the world.Acting is something everyone should try some time in their life, it helps opening up and freely expressing the self.Acting is not as easy as many people make it seem; acting takes up a lot of time, discipline, love, research, want, desire, fire, it takes a lot of effort to truly mold a great role and make a masterpiece of a play/film.";9-17;1;https://www.facebook.com/martnex.maniti;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c810163a3906ddee18;Photo Editing, Photo Retouch, Photoshop Expert;17;3;"THE HIGH-END EFFICIENT PHOTO RETOUCHING IS GUARANTEEDMy name is Daniil and I am a professional photo retoucher with more than 7 years experience. I am Photoshop and Lightroom expert.

In fact, I can hardly imagine my own life passionless. Without passions our life would rather resemble the life of an emotionless plant than the life of a human being. At the same time, I am conscious of the fact that passions play great role in our life and often guide us. However, our passions do not always lead us to great achievements. For instance, people are often affected by passion for material prosperity which forces them to make actions which are not always good or it can even lead them to a crime. But I think we can hardly call it a true, great passion but it is rather a primitive instinct than a passion. On the other hand, I have a perfect example of a true passion that really contributed to my personal development and made me feel that I am a really significant person and that my life is meaningful. My passion is volunteering and help to other people who are in need.;8-16;1;https://www.facebook.com/sourabh.salve.1848;https://www.upwork.com/fl/~014478cc93a9c624e820;Designer with Sketch, Photoshop, Indesign, and Illustrator skills;75;-6;"I have over 15 years leading design direction working in fast paced environments, including inhouse corporate departments and agency organizations.

When you follow a team as closely as I do (Steelers for football, Penguins for hockey), you start to feel as if you've become part of the team. Everybody wants a sense of belonging and community, and sports provides that. The Monday after a big win for the Steelers I can go on to Steelers websites and interact and bond with complete strangers with only one common thread: sports. Whenever something goes wrong in my personal life, there is always a sports world I can escape to.This brings me to my next point: sports bring people together. The best bonding time I ever have with my dad is watching sports together and talking about what we saw. My friends and I can talk for hours about sports. Some of my greatest memories are from our high school football and basketball games. Sports bring people together, strengthen friendships, and provide a time to forget about the rest of the world and enjoy some athletics.";7-16;1;https://www.facebook.com/biksquared;https://www.upwork.com/fl/cindyb1422;Expert Graphic Designer and Photoshop Wizard;45;1;"I won't provide you with any product, that I wouldn't personally use! Rated amongst the TOP 10% in Adobe Photoshop Skills and Photo Editing. More than 14 years of experience in Photoshop, Illustrator and CorelDraw.Strong experience in formatting and publishing E-books.

As a child, I felt absolutely starved for knowledge; I read a good fraction of my town library’s collection growing up. I felt endlessly frustrated that my teachers weren’t teaching me more, and more quickly—in all subjects, but it hurt the most in mathematics and science. I felt betrayed, even when I was young, because I thought it was the teachers’ jobs to teach me everything I wanted to know. I didn’t have any perspective, didn’t realize that my town’s public schools were actually very good, I just knew I was climbing the walls from frustration and boredom. I joke that I invented more math than I was taught growing up—obviously not true, it’s much easier to reverse engineer something than to invent it in the first place. But one of my fondest memories is learning place value notation and multiplication in the same day.I still felt betrayed again every time I went into a class that was taught badly, even in college. It was only natural that I ended up a tutor, trying to be the teacher I never had, repairing damage. I felt knowledge was being withheld from me unfairly and I want to spare others that frustration. Much as skilled doctors make terrible patients, I am an excellent tutor but I’m almost completely unteachable. I’ve started writing books to help students with physics, and I have ideas for many more that I hope to write some day. I am working toward the day when any bright interested 10 year old can master algebra, and know calculus at age 12. If I weren’t a technological incompetent (one of my weaknesses) and bad at collaborating (another big weakness) I’d have invented Khan Academy 15 years earlier. I dream of writing the ultimate math teacher software, a choose-your-own-adventure for all of basic math, a titanic project that, once done, would bring math to *everyone* who wanted it, and wouldn’t create math phobias, wouldn’t turn kids off of math (all kids love math, they just learn to hate math class.)

I wrote a VBA macro for running entire directories - push 1 button, and you can literally walk away - dozens (or even hundreds) of reports update to the latest data with no intervention.- In 1996, I wrote a UPC utility in VBA for adding/stripping UPC digits that is still in use at a $37B drug company - One morning, I was given the task of comparing 12 sets of sheets from 2 separate sources, the person that used to do it took 3 days spot checking the files, by hand. Before lunch, I had written, tested, and debugged VBA code that compares any 2 Excel sheets and had compared every single cell, on all 12 sets, for any differences - color coded by how large the variance. Models/Analysis:I have created dozens of financial models in Excel, examples include:- The full P&L forecasting model that has been used by Star-Kist sine 2008 ($900M+ in sales) - 152 Sheets, 3.7M formulas, Calculates in 15 seconds - allocating costs down to the SKU and Channel for every P&L line item.- Fish cost forecasting model that takes projected fish costs and forecasts amortization down to finished goods SKU level by month.- Build/Burn analysis model that takes all products shipped vs Nielsen and retailer POS to project inventory movement by customer.- Weekly retail (POS) consumption application and analytical tools that consolidated Nielsen Data, Wal-mart (when Wal-mart was not reporting into Nielsen) Club, C-Store, Dollar store, etc and gave a 98%+ complete view of all consumption.Formatting Charts and Data:I have created scorecards and dashboards that not only look nice, but convey the important information in the most understandable way. For Example, New Item Scorecards that are color coordinated with the products - Blue Themed for Wild Planet Tuna, Green/Black themed for Wild Selections Tuna, so users can quickly find the correct report in a stack of dozens of reports and each chart in the report is displayed in the best format for that data.Optimizing:I also optimize Excel files for speed and size and have taken files in the 5MB range and reduced to 0.5MB range with no loss of data or functionality, and have optimized files that take nearly 1 minute to calculate and reduced that to under 15 seconds, again with no loss of data or functionality.";"Anything that commands my deep thinking process.
